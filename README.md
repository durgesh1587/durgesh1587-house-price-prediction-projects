#House Price Prediction
Predicting house prices using machine learning algorithms.

#About
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the selling price of houses based on various features.

##Features##
Utilizes machine learning algorithms for regression analysis.
Provides a user-friendly interface for predicting house prices.
Allows users to input various features such as the number of bedrooms, location, and square footage to get a predicted house price.

#Getting Started#
